# Travelling Salesman Problem

A solution to the [Travelling Salesman Problem](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem>)  

# Algorithms

## Brute Force

Searches every permutation returning the shortest, so the solution is always optimal but has O(n!) complexity.

## Genetic

An implementation of a [Genetic algorithm](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm>) using [Two-point](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_(genetic_algorithm)#Two-point_and_k-point_crossover>) crossover.
